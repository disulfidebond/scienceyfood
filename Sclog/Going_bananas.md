# Going Bananas!

There's a reason it's nearly impossible to find ripe bananas at the grocery store. Bananas are harvested when they’re unripe and green, and this isn’t just because they have to be shipped from a tropical climate. Agricultural bananas ripen slowly when the peels release ethylene, which acts as a trigger to turn the bananas yellow. As they ripen, the sugars and starches inside the bananas also begin to change. The less ripe a banana is, the more starch it will have. Starches have several properties, and in bananas they give the fruit a more firm texture, and a strong “banana-like” taste. As banana ripens further, the starches begin to breakdown into sugars. These sugars are more pliable than starches, and give the banana a mushier texture. If given enough time, the sweetness taste of these sugars will overpower the banana-like taste of the banana.

This is important, because depending on what dish you are making, you may want a more or less ripe banana.


If you are making Bananas Foster, you want a ripe but not overly ripe banana, because you want a strong banana-taste in the dish.

If you are making banana bread, you want very ripe or over ripe bananas, because the banana provides most of the sweet taste to the bread.

You've probably read online or heard that keeping fruit in a brown paper bag will help it ripen. There's a reason for that: the ethylene gas.

Ethylene gas breaks down quickly in visible light or UV light, meaning it will quickly degrade when light hits it, and it won't hang around very well to be able to ripen the banana if you simply set the banana on the counter.
Eventually the banana will ripen, but it will take more time.

If you keep it in a relatively airtight container, and also block as much light as possible from reaching the banana by using a brown paper bag, the ethylene gas that is released from the banana peel
will have time to hang around and speed up the banana's ripening process.
