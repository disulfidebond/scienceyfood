# Flambé means Fire!

In fancy restaurants, you've probably seen waiters light dessert dishes on fire, which is called flambéing a dish. While impressive, it's not something you should try at home.  Seriously.

First, some terminology and chemistry. In the United States, the "proof" of an alcoholic beverage is assigned by [determining the percent alcohol by volume of a spirit beverage, and then doubling it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_proof). Most liquors are 80 proof, or 40% alcohol by volume. Wines range from 20-40 proof, usually 28 proof or 14% alcohol by volume.

The flash point of a substance is the temperature at which it will ignite if exposed to a spark or flame. 100 proof liquor will ignite at about room temperature, but 80 proof or even 30 proof liquors can [ignite if they are heated to a temperature above 100 degrees Farenheit, which a stove will very quickly reach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol#Flammability).

If you're thinking "fire isn't so bad", please stop reading immediately and stay out of all kitchens.

A pan that has something actively burning is very difficult to control. There's heat coming from below, inside, and on top of the pan, and the flames can readily ignite other surfaces. If liquid inside a pan is on fire, there's the added hazard that the fire is actively sloshing around. One of the reasons the Bananas Foster recipe specifically says not to use Bacardi 151 is that 151-proof liquor will ignite at room temperature, and will literally create a fireball if it is heated and then exposed to an ignition source like a spark or flame. The other reason is that the alcohol taste will tend to overpower the dish.

If you're cooking and something catches fire, here are some important guidelines you must follow:

## Rule 1: NEVER use water to put out a kitchen fire.

## Rule 2: NEVER EVER use water to put out a kitchen fire.

Flames will be on top of a liquid or substance.

If you have a water-soluble liquid that is on fire and you throw water on it, then the water will dissolve into the liquid, and then slosh around the flames. There's also a good chance that throwing water on the flames will briefly cause the flames to flare, because the waves created by the water hitting the liquid will add more combustible liquid to the flames.

If you throw water on an oil or grease fire, what happens is far worse. Water and oil don't mix, and oil is less dense than water. If you add water to an oil fire, the water will sink to the bottom of the liquid that is burning, then the water will get heated and evaporate, *pushing* the flaming liquid outwards!

# Rule 3: Place a lid over the pan. This will starve it of oxygen and cause the flames to die.

Be aware that if the lid has a close fit over the pan, it may become firmly stuck on the pan. This is ok. What's happening is when the flames die, it temporarily creates a large difference in temprature in the air inside the pan, which causes a vacuum to form, sticking the lid firmly to the pan. The vacuum will fade and the lid will release itself when the temperature in the pan cools.

# Rule 4: Use a [Class B](https://www.nationwide.com/lc/resources/home/articles/fire-extinguisher-safety) fire extinguisher to extinguish the flames.

Any food not in a sealed container will need to be thrown away if you use a fire extinguisher on a kitchen fire.

# Rule 5: Throw baking soda on it

Baking Soda is not flammable, and can be used to extinguish fires, but you usually need a lot of it (a small retail box will probably not work).

# Rule 6: GET TO SAFETY and call 911

If you are unable to extinguish the fire, get yourself and everyone to safety and call 911. Possessions can be replaced, but lives cannot.
