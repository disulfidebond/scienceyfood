# Bubble, Bubble, yeast isn't trouble!

Both Baker's Yeast and Brewer's Yeast are *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, but they're different strains, and behave slightly differently. Yeast is what allows bread to rise, which means the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, baker's yeast strain, converts sugars into carbon dioxide.
These pockets of carbon dioxide lift the bread and form small holes in it. These holes are the texture that you can see in any baked bread.
The yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, brewer's yeast strain, also converts sugar into carbon dioxide, but it does it more slowly, and you usually need something else to make the bread rise (see [Beer Bread](https://github.com/disulfidebond/scienceyfood/blob/master/Recipes/BeerBread.md)).
Brewer's yeast is also more tolerant of ethanol, which makes it a better choice for brewing beer and wine.

Another way to make bread and breadlike dishes rise is baking soda and baking powder. Baking soda is a base, and when it encounters anything acidic, it releases carbon dioxide.
This is similar to the very popular vinegar-baking soda volcano, but picture it happening on a smaller scale. The tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide create the texture of bread, and give it more "poofiness".
