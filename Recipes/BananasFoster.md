# Bananas Foster 

## Introduction
Bananas Foster was created by [Ralph Brennan](https://www.brennansneworleans.com/recipes/bananas-foster/) in New Orleans, as was reportedly one of his favorite desserts. This recipe is derived from his, and full credit goes to Brennan for the creation of it.

You should use ripe but not overly ripe bananas (see my sclog entry [Going Bananas!](https://github.com/disulfidebond/scienceyfood/blob/master/Sclog/Going_bananas.md)).

[Flambéing a dish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flambé) is very dangerous, even for a veteran chef, and although it is impressive, you should **NOT LIGHT THE DISH ON FIRE**.  I'm really serious. 

For an interesting commentary about why you should **NOT LIGHT THE DISH ON FIRE**, read my sclog entry [Flambé means Fire!](https://github.com/disulfidebond/scienceyfood/blob/master/Sclog/Flambe_means_Fire.md)

Finally, the dish will contain some alcohol after preparation is complete, even if the dish catches fire, which would be bad and you should avoid at all costs. There wouldn't be enough alcohol to make you drunk, but it is conceivable that your blood alcohol level could raise a bit after enjoying the dish.

## Modifications
Any dark rum will work, but you should not use rum that is higher than 100 proof. If you use spiced rum, do not add cinnamon, or only add a dash of cinnamon.

## Ingredients

* 1/4 cup Dark Rum
* 1/3 cup Amaretto or Banana liqueur 
* 2-3 bananas sliced lengthwise
* 1/2 cup brown sugar (dark for sweeter taste, light for richer taste)
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* 2 tbsp butter 

## Steps

1. Combine butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon in saucepan on medium heat. 
2. Add the rum and liquor after the butter melts, stirring constantly. Then carefully add the bananas, continuing to stir.
3. When the bananas are softened (about 1 minute of cooking), the dish is done. Immediately serve over ice cream and enjoy!
