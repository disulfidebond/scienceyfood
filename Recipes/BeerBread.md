# Beer Bread

## Introduction
The choice of beer will add a distinct flavor to the bread, and you can have a lot of fun experimenting with different flavor combinations. However, many breweries filter their beer, which removes most of the yeast. 
If it's very important that you have Brewer's Yeast in your bread, look for glass bottled artisanal beers that have a small amount of sediment at the bottom of the bottle.
Brewer's Yeast does not provide sufficient leavening to produce a "loaf" of bread. In other words, with this recipe, you're baking unleavened bread that's a little "poofier" than flatbread.


**Ingredients**

* 4 cups all purpose flour
* 0.5 tablespoon salt
* 1 cup of beer
* 1 cup of water
* 3 tablespoons of sugar
* 1 tablespoon of baking soda OR baking powder

# Modifications

## General
Feel free to experiment with different types of beer. Wheat beers and ales will have a milder "wheatier" flavor, while lagers will add a more pronounced flavor.

If you want, you can add 2 tablespoons of yeast **instead** of 1 tablespoon baking powder, which will make the more typical loaf of sandwich bread.

# Steps
1. Measure out the 4c of flour, 1 tbsp baking powder, 0.5 tbsp of salt, and 2 tbsp sugar, then mix these together in a large mixing bowl. Pour the 1c water and 1c beer into the flour-yeast--sugar-salt mixture.
2. Stir together until the consistency is soft and dough-like, then roll into small spheres of dough
3. Grease a cookie sheet and gently then set the dough balls on the cookie sheet. Put the cookie sheet in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown.

Once it's finished baking, pull it out of the oven and let it sit in the cookie sheet for 5 minutes, then carefully remove the bread and let it cool on a wire cooling rack. Enjoy!
