# Bread

## Introduction
Bread is one of the staple foods, and there are countless variations. This recipe is for simple sandwich bread.

**Ingredients**

* 3 cups all purpose flour
* 1 cup of wheat flour
* 2 tablespoons yeast
* 0.5 tablespoon salt
* 1.75 cups water
* 0.25 cups olive oil
* 1 tablespoon of honey OR 1 tablespoon of sugar

## Modifications

### General
You can let the dough rise for up to 30 minutes before baking it.

### Flour
The type of flour has a large impact on the texture and taste of the bread. 
If you don't like wheat flour or can't find any, then you can substitute 1 cup of bread flour instead.
If you don't have any bread flour, you can use 4 cups of all purpose flour, but be aware that it will have the consistency of a pastry, and the crust will tend to flake off.

Bread flour is higher in protein and gluten, and will give the bread a more chewy texture.
All purpose flour has been refined but has less protein, and will be more flaky than chewy--sometimes this is what you want.
Wheat flour is higher in fiber, and has a distinct taste, however it usually is not enriched with vitamins like folate and iron.

### Yeast
Yeast is what allows bread to rise, which means the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, baker's yeast strain, converts sugars into carbon dioxide.
These pockets of carbon dioxide lift the bread and form small holes in it. These holes are the texture that you can see in any baked bread.
The yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, brewer's yeast strain, also converts sugar into carbon dioxide, but it does it more slowly, and you usually need something else to make the bread rise (see [Beer Bread]()).

### Baking Powder
Another way to make bread and breadlike dishes rise is baking soda and baking powder. Baking soda is a base, and when it encounters anything acidic, it releases carbon dioxide.
This is similar to the very popular vinegar-baking soda volcano, but picture it happening on a smaller scale.

If you are running low on yeast, you can use 1 tablespoon of yeast, and the bread will still rise a little, and be good sandwich bread.
If you don't have any baker's yeast, see the [Beer Bread]() recipe, or you can substitute 1 tablespoon of baking powder for the yeast.

Be aware that if you substitute baking powder for yeast, you should instead roll the dough out into small spheres and not use a bread pan, because the dough will not rise much. You also don't need to let the bread rise before baking it if you don't use yeast.


## Steps
1. Measure out the 4c of flour, 2 tbsp yeast, 0.5 tbsp of salt, and mix together in a large mixing bowl. Mix the 2c of water, 0.25c of oil, and 1 tbsp of honey (or sugar), in a measuring cup, and then pour this into the flour-yeast-salt mixture.
2. Stir together until the consistency is soft and dough-like. Then, knead the dough with your hands for 5 minutes, which will break up any large pockets of carbon dioxide that formed from the yeast.
3. Grease a bread pan (or cookie sheet if you don't have a bread pan), and then set the dough inside. Cover the dough, and turn on the oven to 350F. When the oven temperature reaches 350F, put the bread pan with dough into the oven and bake for 35 minutes.

Once it's finished baking, pull it out of the oven and let it sit in the breadpan (or cookie sheet) for 5 minutes, then carefully remove the bread and let it cool on a wire cooling rack. Enjoy!
