# Catfish Almondine

## Introduction
This is a yummy fish dish that's simple and easy to make. Catfish has a distinct taste that some may not like, but it's what I grew up on and is a favorite of mine.

**Ingredients**
2 catfish filets
2 tbsp butter
1 tbsp dress parsley, diced
1 clove of garlic finely minced
1/2 tsp Cajun Seasoning
Black pepper grinder
Kosher salt
1/2 lemon
2 tbsp slivered almonds 

## Modifications

### General
You can use less garlic if you want.

## Steps
1. Preheat oven to 350 F, and lightly grease baking sheet.

2. Sprinkle salt (max 1/4 tsp) on both sides of catfish filet, then lightly cover both sides with freshly ground black pepper. Place filets on baking sheet. 

3. Melt butter, and mix in parsley and garlic. Then squeeze lemon juice into butter mix and add almonds and Cajun seasoning (remove lemon seeds prior to squeezing), and immediately add to the top of the catfish filets on the cookie sheet.

Bake for 15 minutes or until fish flakes with a fork.
