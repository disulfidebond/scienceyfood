## Welcome to Sciencey Food!

We've all been there, or are there now. It's the pandemic, grocery stores are running low on food, social distancing is keeping you isolated, parks and stores are closed, and instagram became boring days ago. You're clinging onto your sanity by your very clean fingernails on your thoroughly washed hands, and have binged watched numerous TV shows. If you're like me, you productively used this time to build a very impressive \[citation needed\] castle in Minecraft.

Then, the inevitable happens.  You get hungry. Your pantry is stocked with essentials like beer and liquor, but how do you turn foodlike items like flour and sugar into tasty bread for that all-imporant PB&J? 

This repository is here to help! It has recipes for entrees, dishes, and desserts that have been simplified to 3 simple steps. It's focused on using commonly available ingredients, and it provides annotations and comments for how to substitute ingredients that may be missing. In recipes that are derived from others, credit has been added to the original creators.

In addition,the Science Blog ("sclog", yes I need a better name...) section has a commentary about the science in the chemical reactions of several dishes.

Always be safe and responsible in the kitchen, and always heed all warnings and cautions that are in any of these recipes. 

Each recipe is formatted as follows:

Introduction: Describes the recipe and provides a list of required ingredients

Modifications: Lists what ingredients can be modified or substituted

Steps: The actual steps to cook or bake.
